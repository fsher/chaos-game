# Game of Chaos
This is a simple demo of a game of chaos.

Inspired by [Numberphile's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs)

## What can I do with this?
1. Clone repo
2. Open `index.html`
3. Put 3 dots on the canvas to make a triangle (a right triangle makes this very pretty :3)
4. Put the initial dot somewhere randomly.
5. Press 'Start'
6. Move the Range selector to adjust the speed (Left - faster, right - slower)
